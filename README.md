# Two approaches to Traveling Salesman Problem
Comparison between a Non-AI and two AI techniques to solve the TSP. 
The non-AI technique used is a greedy algorithm. 
A Genetic algorithm and Simulated Annealing are the two intelligent techniques used to solve the NP-hard problem.

## Usage

To run type `bash main.sh` from the working directory of this project.
Each algorithm will output a graph to show the salesman's route.
This provides easy comparison of the three approaches.

In the command line output, all quantitative information is printed.

**NOTE** you must close the graph to move on to the next algorithm.
